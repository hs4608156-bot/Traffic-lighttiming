# Traffic-lighttiming
Traffic Light Timing Optimizer is a Python-based project that uses a Greedy Algorithm to allocate green light durations efficiently across multiple intersections. By analyzing the number of vehicles at each signal, it distributes available time proportionally to minimize overall waiting time and improve traffic flow.
